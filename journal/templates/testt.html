    <p>The Biology Students’ Research Society (BSRS) is a youth research organization established in 1995.
        It started as a progressive idea from enthusiastic biology students thriving for more challenges
        and grew to be one of the oldest youth organizations in the country today. Besides that, it
        represents one among the few youth-research organizations in Macedonia, with continuous work
        of more than 25 years. Many generations took part and left mark passing the passion for biology
        onto future generations. This makes BSRS self-organizing structure, led only by biology students.

    <p>The three core goals of the Society are: <strong>Education, Research and Publication</strong></p>
    <p>In order to promote knowledge, the Society educates its members and the public in biology-related topics.
        This is accomplished by different activities around the year such as organizing courses, classes, and
        events that help students to improve their skills. Some of these events are open to the broader public.
        Gaining theoretical knowledge is followed by doing practical work. Regarding this, the Society organizes
        activities such as field expeditions and excursions. In this way, young biologists are trained for different
        field methodologies, but also have an opportunity to contribute to the knowledge of Macedonia’s biodiversity.
        Last but not least, the Society offers a place for students to experience by learning and practicing, writing
        of scientific articles. This is possible thanks to the Bulletin of the Biology Students’ Research Society tha
        t is being published once in a few years. This closes the circle in the process of professional growth of one
        biologist during their undergraduate studies. Students get educated and get to promote knowledge (promote
        biology in this regard), as well as an opportunity to collect biological material on the field. Finally,
        they have an opportunity to learn alongside mentors on how to write and have a place to promote their results
        . This system overcomes the limits of formal education and develops more skillful biologists in general.
        Also, represents a positive example for the great cooperation with other parties (professors, assistants,
        other organizations, supporters) as well as for strong teamwork among students themselves.
        Society’s working structure consists of many sections that are fully or partially functioning
        (entomology, algology, floristic, landscape ecology, mycology, ornithology, arachnology,
        mammology, macrozoobenthos, and others.). Each section has a different study focus and is
        led by a more experienced member (professor, assistant, expert) who has a mentoring role.
        Biological materials collected from field activities and are being proceeded, labeled and
        sorted at the Institute of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics in Skopje.</p>
